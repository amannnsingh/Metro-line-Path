# Metro-line-Path
Dijkstra's algorithm is a shortest path algorithm used in metro route planning to find the quickest route between stations. It models the metro network as a graph, where stations are nodes and tracks are edges with weights representing travel time or distance. The algorithm initializes all distances to infinity except the starting station (set to 0) and uses a priority queue to explore the shortest paths iteratively. It updates neighboring station distances and backtracks to reconstruct the shortest route once the destination is reached. This efficient method helps in real-time navigation, optimizing travel time across complex metro networks. ðŸš‡
